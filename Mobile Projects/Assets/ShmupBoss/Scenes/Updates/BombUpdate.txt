Added in V2.1
Quite simple to use, just add a "Bomb" component to an empty game object in your scene or use the "Edit" menu, "Shmup Boss", "Weapons", "Add Bomb Feature" which will do the same thing.

You will also find Bomb Pickup and Firing Bomb agent events in your FX Spawner Player and SFX Player.

Make sure to give the bomb a bomb timer to space out bombs, otherwise all bombs will be fired with a single click.
I've also added a Unity Event if you want to start methods when a bomb is fired.
